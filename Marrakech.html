 <h1> Marrakech</h1>
<p class="paragraph"> Marrakesh is possibly the second most important of Morocco's four former imperial cities after Fez. The region has been inhabited by Berber farmers since Neolithic times,
   but the actual city was founded in 1062, by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, chieftain and cousin of Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin.  </p>
<p class="paragraph">  In the 12th century, the Almoravids built many madrasas (Koranic schools) and mosques in Marrakesh that bear Andalusian influences.
   The red walls of the city, built by Ali ibn Yusuf in 1122–1123, and various buildings constructed in red sandstone during this period, have given the city
    the nickname of the "Red City" or "Ochre City".
  Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural, religious </p>
<p class="paragraph"> After a period of decline, the city was surpassed by Fez, but in the early 16th century, Marrakesh again became the capital of the kingdom.
  The city regained its preeminence under wealthy Saadian sultans Abu Abdallah al-Qaim and Ahmad al-Mansur
  , who embellished the city with sumptuous palaces such as the El Badi Palace (1578) and restored many ruined monuments.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> Beginning in the 17th century, the city became popular among Sufi pilgrims for Morocco's seven patron saints,
   who are entombed here. In 1912 the French Protectorate in Morocco was established
  and T'hami El Glaoui became Pasha of Marrakesh and held this position nearly throughout the protectorate </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Like many Moroccan cities, Marrakesh comprises an old fortified city packed with vendors and their stalls
  (the medina, a UNESCO World Heritage Site),[6] bordered by modern neighbourhoods, the most prominent of which is Gueliz.
   Today it is one of the busiest cities in Africa
   and serves as a major economic center and tourist destination. Tourism is strongly advocated by the reigning Moroccan monarch</p>
<p class="paragraph">  Mohammed VI, with the goal of doubling the number of tourists visiting Morocco to 20 million by 2020. Despite the economic recession,
  real estate and hotel development in Marrakesh have grown dramatically in the 21st century. Marrakesh is particularly popular with the French,
   and numerous French celebrities own property in the city. Marrakesh has the largest traditional market (souk) in Morocco </p>
<p class="paragraph">Marrakesh is served by Ménara International Airport and the Marrakesh railway station, which connects the city to Casablanca and northern Morocco.
   Marrakesh has several universities and schools, including Cadi Ayyad University. A number of Moroccan football clubs are located here </p>
<p class="paragraph"> The exact meaning of the name is debated.[11] One possible origin of the name Marrakesh is from the Berber (Amazigh
  ) words amur (n) akush (ⴰⵎⵓⵔ ⵏ ⴰⴽⵓⵛ), which means "Land of God".[5] According to historian Susan Searight, however,
  the town's name was first documented in an 11th-century manuscript in the Qarawiyyin library in Fez,
   where its meaning was given as "country of the sons of Kush</p>
