 <h1> The Grenadines</h1>
<p class="paragraph"> the time to explore the depth and breadth of experiences available in this diverse region.
<strong>  The Grenadines </strong> , a chain of dozens of islands south of St. Vincent,
  were spared by the 2017 storms (in fact, the last time they experienced a direct hit from a hurricane was over 60 years ago). </p>
<p class="paragraph">But only recently has the tourism infrastructure and local economy come to match the archipelago’s raw natural beauty.
  This year, one island in particular  — Bequia — will be in focus thanks to the highly anticipated opening of the liming</p>
<p class="paragraph">a sleek resort that comprises nine clean-lined private villas and a luxe manor home. But other islands are also on the up and up.
  Mandarin Oriental recently took over the management of ,
  which officially rebranded in July with just 26 suites and 13 exclusive villas on a prime section of Godahl Beach. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Canouan has also built a runway to allow private and charter jet access. And ,
  on the famed private island of Mustique, continues to draw visitors two years after an extensive renovation.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> <strong> The Grenadines </strong> are a chain of small islands that lie on a
   line between the larger islands of Saint Vincent and Grenada in the Lesser Antilles.
   Nine are inhabited,
   including the mainland Saint Vincent and the Grenadines islands: Young Island, Bequia, Mustique, Canouan, Union Island, Mayreau, </p>
<p class="paragraph">The northern two-thirds of the chain, including about 32 islands and cays, are part of the country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
  The southern third of the chain belongs to the country of Grenada.
   Carriacou is the largest and most populous of the Grenadines (excluding Grenada).</p>
<p class="paragraph"> They are divided between the island nations of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada.
  They lie between the islands of Saint Vincent in the north and Grenada in the south. Neither Saint Vincent nor Grenada are Grenadine islands.
   The islands north of the Martinique Channel belong to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the islands south of the channel belong to Grenada.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> The total population of the Grenadine islands within Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is estimated to be 10,234.[1]
  The following islands make up the Grenadines Parish</p>
