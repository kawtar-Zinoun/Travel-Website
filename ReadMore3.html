    Tourism will only grow once Giza’s $1.1 billion  makes its long-awaited debut in 2020 </p>
<p class="paragraph">From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century, Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers:
  The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire. Modern Egypt dates back to 1922, when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy.
   However, British military occupation of Egypt continued,
  and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism. Following the 1952 revolution </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Islam is the official religion of Egypt and Arabic is its official language.[13] With over 95 million inhabitants,
  Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Arab world,
   the third-most populous in Africa (after Nigeria and Ethiopia), and the fifteenth-most populous in the world. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi),
   where the only arable land is found.
   The large regions of the Sahara desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> The sovereign state of Egypt is a transcontinental country considered to be a regional power in North Africa,
  the Middle East and the Muslim world, and a middle power worldwide.[14] Egypt's economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East,
   and is projected to become one of the largest in the world
</p>
<p class="paragraph">  In 2016, Egypt overtook South Africa and became Africa's second largest economy (after Nigeria).[15][16]
   Egypt is a founding member of the United Nations,
  Non-Aligned Movement, Arab League, African Union, and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> The English name "Egypt" is derived from the Ancient Greek "Aígyptos" ("Αἴγυπτος"), via Middle French "Egypte" and Latin "Aegyptus".
   It is reflected in early Greek Linear B tablets as "a-ku-pi-ti-yo". The adjective "aigýpti-"/"aigýptios" was borrowed into Coptic as "gyptios",
  and from there into Arabic as "qubṭī", back formed into "قبط" ("qubṭ"), whence English "Copt". </p>
<p class="paragraph"> There is evidence of rock carvings along the Nile terraces and in desert oases. In the 10th millennium BCE,
   a culture of hunter-gatherers and fishers was replaced by a grain-grinding culture.
  Climate changes or overgrazing around 8000 BCE began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the Sahara.</p>
