<h1> The Andaman Islands</h1>
<p class="paragraph"> For anyone who’s ever fantasized about running away to a remote island, the Andaman Islands are the stuff of dreams.
  A chain of more than 300 islands (some sources cite as many as 572)
 they seem almost too perfect to be real, with unspoiled beaches, clear water, coconut trees, and tropical mangroves.
 Many of the archipelago’s islands are uninhabited or off-limits in order to protect the tribes who live there. </p>
  <p class="paragraph"> But one, Havelock Island,
 became more accessible this March, the Andamans’ first five-star resort — opened on Radhanagar Beach.
 Spread out over 30 acres, the property comprises 75 luxurious villas inspired by the huts of the indigenous Jarawa tribe,
 three restaurants serving local specialties and global cuisine, </p>
 <p class="paragraph">
 and the tranquil Jiva spa. It joins Havelock’s other main draw, the charming boutique hotel
  which opened in late 2015 with just three rooms, three suites, and a private villa on an old banana and betel nut plantation.
  Days here are spent swimming and diving amid the coral, kayaking in the mangroves, hiking in the forest, and relaxing on the beach. </p>
   <p class="paragraph"> For now, the Andamans remain far less developed
   than the Maldives, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. Go before that changes.
 </p>
 <p class ="paragraph"> The Andaman Islands form an archipelago in the Bay of Bengal between India, to the west, and Myanmar,
   to the north and east. Most are part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Union Territory of India,
    while a small number in the north of the archipelago, including the Coco Islands, belong to Myanmar.</p>
   <p class ="paragraph"> The Andaman Islands are home to the Andamanese,
      a group of indigenous people that includes a number of tribes including the Jarawa and Sentinelese tribes.[1]
       While some of the islands can be visited with permits,
      others including the North Sentinel island are banned for entry by law. </p>
    <p class ="paragraph"> The origin of the name Andaman is disputed and not well known.

In the 13th century, the name of Andaman appears in Chinese as Yen-to-man (晏陀蠻) in the book Zhu Fan Zhi by Zhao Rugua.[3] In Chapter 38 of the book,
 Countries In The Sea,
Zhao Rugua specifies that going from Lambri (Sumatra) to Ceylon, it is an unfavourable wind which makes ships drift towards Andaman Islands </p>
     <p class ="paragraph">The earliest archaeological evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years; however, the indications from genetic,
        cultural and isolation studies suggest that the islands may have been inhabited as early as the Middle Paleolithic.[5]
       The indigenous Andamanese people appear to have lived on the islands in substantial isolation from that time until the 18th century AD. </p>
      <p class ="paragraph"> In 1789, the Bengal Presidency established a naval base and penal colony on Chatham Island in the southeast bay of Great Andaman.
        The settlement is now known as Port Blair (after the Bombay Marine lieutenant Archibald Blair who founded it). After two years,
      the colony was moved to the northeast part of Great Andaman and was named Port Cornwallis after Admiral William Cornwallis.</p>
