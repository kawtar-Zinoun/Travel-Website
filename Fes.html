 <h1> Fes</h1>
 <p class="paragraph"> Being one of the most important cities in Morocco, <strong> Fez </strong> is rich in culture, history, traditions, gastronomy and much more!
    With one of the first universities and the oldest medieval Medina in the world,
    this city has a lot to offer and there is something new and exciting to do each day. Here are the 10 best things to see and do in Fez. </p>
 <p class="paragraph"> <strong>Al Quaraouiyine </strong> was built in 859 AD by Fatima al-Fihri, and is believed to be one of the oldest universities in the world.
   It now operates as a mosque and cannot be entered by non-Muslims.
    However, its library was renovated in 2016 and made open to the public, and you can get a glimpse of the impressive</p>
 <p class="paragraph"> Located in the Medina, <strong> Dar Batha </strong> is a former palace that was turned into a museum in 1915, with an amazing
    collection of traditional artifacts. It has a fantastic Andalusian-style garden at its entrance, with varying types of plants, aromas and sounds,
     plus mosaics and a water fountain. Inside, you’ll find fine woodcarvings,
    Moroccan tiles, embroidery, carpets and even a ceramic collection from the 14th century.</p>
 <p class="paragraph"> <strong> Chouara Tannery</strong> This is the most iconic place in Fez, and the oldest tannery in the world,
    where they still operate like they did in medieval times.
    Here men make leather in a massive tannery surrounded by houses and shops. The smell can get rather intense, so a scarf to cover your nose
    (or some mint leaves to rub under it) is advised, as this is definitely a unique site to behold. </p>
 <p class="paragraph">  <strong> Merenid tombs </strong> ,These tombs house the skeletal remains of sultans and other royals of the Merenid Dynasty. Although not intact,
   and most of the decorations and engravings have faded throughout the years, you can still see the authenticity of the architecture.</p>
