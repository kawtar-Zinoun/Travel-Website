<h1>Berlin,Germany</h1>
<img class="thePicture" src="img/photoArticle2.jpg" alt="photo" title="Berlin" style="margin-top: 10px;">
<p class="paragraph"> The coming year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the berlin wall fall of the
   and city's jam-packed cultural calendar reflects its post-reunification renaissance.
  Exhibits and performances celebrating  </p>
<p class="paragraph">starting in January with a ramped-up opening festival at the Akademie der Kunste, which will include lectures,
  dance and theatrical performances, and concerts — and, this being one of Europe's capitals of nightlife,
  a pop-up nightclub featuring DJ sets and the presentation of a Bauhaus manifesto for the 21st century. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> The party will be bookended by the debut later in the year of the  in the Berlin Palace.
   The sprawling complex will include the Ethnological and Asian Art museums, as well as a Berlin Exhibition that explores how the city,
   now a hub of diversity, interacts with the rest of the world and grapples with issues of cultural appropriation.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The year's biggest surprise, though, may be the emergence of  — a meat and potatoes epicenter,
  and the only city in the world boasting a museum devoted to the currywurst — as a veg-friendly culinary mecca.
  The city is now home to more vegetarian restaurants than any other European capital, and Vevolution,  </p>
<p class="paragraph"> a celebration focused on vegan and vegetarian cuisine, will be part of the city's  in February,
   a culinary blowout slated to draw world-renowned chefs like Slovenia’s Ana Roš and Austria’s Heinz Reitbauer.  </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Berlin lies in northeastern Germany, east of the River (Saxon or Thuringian) Saale, that once constituted,
   together with the River Elbe (from their confluence onwards), the eastern border of the Frankish Realm. While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited
   by Germanic tribes like the Franks and the Saxons,
   the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by Slavic tribes. </p>
<p class="paragraph">  Typical Germanised place name suffixes of Slavic origin are -ow, -itz, -vitz, -witz, -itzsch and -in,
   prefixes are Windisch and Wendisch. The name Berlin has its roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin,
   and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl- ("swamp").[21] Since the Ber- at the beginning sounds like the German word Bär (bear),
   a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore a canting arm.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> Of Berlin's twelve boroughs, five bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Pankow (the most populous), Steglitz-Zehlendorf,
   Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Treptow-Köpenick and Spandau (named Spandow until 1878). Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name:
    Altglienicke, Alt-Treptow, Britz, Buch, Buckow, Gatow, Karow, Kladow, Köpenick, Lankwitz, Lübars, Malchow, Marzahn, Pankow, Prenzlauer Berg, Rudow, Schmöckwitz,
    Spandau, Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow, Steglitz, Tegel and Zehlendorf. The neighborhood of Moabit bears a French-derived name, and Französisch Buchholz
     is named after the Huguenots</p>
